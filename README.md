## My .dotfiles

### Requirements
None (_yet_)

### Install
- Clone onto your laptop:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/evertonfragoso/.dotfiles.git
```

- Run setup file:
```bash
$ cd .dotfiles
$ ./setup
```

#### Troubleshooting
In case the `setup` return error when called, check it's permissions, it must be executable. If it's not, run the following command:
```bash
$ chmod +x ./setup
```
and try to run `setup` again
```bash
$ ./setup
```
